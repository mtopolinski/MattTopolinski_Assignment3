Assignment 3
CIS-385: Programming for the Web
Build a simple, static note-taking site using Node.js, Express framework.

Objectives:
  * Start a Node/Express application.
  * Create 3 static pages. You can start with http://www.initializr.com/.

Create a repository
  *Create a Github repository called FirstNameLastName_Assignment3
    o It can be public or private
    o If it is private, go to Settings -> Collaborators and add bendalgaard
  * Add a .gitignore file for Node.js
  * Add a README.md file

Layout
  * All pages should have a header and a footer.
  * Headers should have a link to each page, but be inactive for the page you are currently on.
  * Menu should collapse for “small” screens.
  * The footer should have CIS395 in the left corner.
  
Screen 1: Login
  Create a login page with Username and Password. Assume that a button click to login is always successful and leads to the second screen.

Screen 2: List of Notes
  This is simply a list of notes. You should have at least 10 note names that link to the third page (all the same link). When the screen is made small enough that the whole list cannot fit onto the page, the list overflow should be scrollable
Finally, there should be a button to add a new note (this can also just lead to the third screen).

Problem 3: Note Editor
  This screen will have a large, editable title at the top of the page. It will have 2 buttons, SAVE and DELETE. When these buttons are clicked, a pop up message will show the used that this was successful (even though they do not call back to the server yet).
The bulk of the screen will be a large, editable text area.

Logging
  Whenever one of these routes is called, you should log that the request was received and server the page.
